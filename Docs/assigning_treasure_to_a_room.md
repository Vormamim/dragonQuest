### Asigning Treasures to a room
## assignTreasures.py
## An explanation

In this example, we first import the json and random modules, and load the game data and treasure data into Python dictionaries.

We then define a function assign_treasures() that randomly assigns each treasure to a room. The function first creates a list of room names using the .keys() method, and then uses the random.choice() function to select a random room for each treasure. The function updates the location field of each treasure to the name of the randomly selected room.

Next, the function loops over the rooms in the game data and adds a treasure field to each room data that contains a list of the treasures assigned to that room.

Finally, we define a function print_descriptions_with_treasures() that prints all the room descriptions and the treasures assigned to each room. The function accesses the game_data['locations'] dictionary and loops over the items using the .items() method. For each room, it prints its name, description, and the list of treasures assigned to it.

Finally, we call the print_descriptions_with_treasures() function to display all the room descriptions with assigned treasures.
