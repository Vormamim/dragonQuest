Trizbort allows you to save the map data as a YAML file. Here's how you can do it:

Open the Trizbort software and create or open the map file that you want to save as YAML.

Click on the "File" menu at the top of the window, and then click on "Export".

In the Export dialog box, select "YAML" as the file type.

Choose the location where you want to save the YAML file and enter a file name.

Click on the "Save" button to save the file.

The Trizbort map data will be saved in the YAML format and can be opened and edited using a text editor or loaded into a programming language such as Python using a YAML library.
